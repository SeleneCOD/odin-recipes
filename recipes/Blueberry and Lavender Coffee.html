<p>  This Blueberry and Lavender Coffee recipe was something I came up with while on my search for coffee creamer at Trader Joe's.I have always loved the taste of lavender in my coffee, but when
    I saw this beverage contained blueberries, I had to give it a try! The lady at the check out counter even gave me the thumbs up, she said it was delicious. Now, I want to share my recipe for the world to try.
