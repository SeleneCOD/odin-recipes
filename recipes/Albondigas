alt="Albondigas Mexican Soup">
<p>  Albondigas soup is a traditional Mexican meatball soup ("albondigas" means "meatballs" in Spanish).
    It is our version of comfort food. This Dish is savory and it's perfect for the fall and winter weather.
Although, seasons do not limit our family to make this dish. It is too delicious not to enjoy year round.
 </p>
<p> The soup base is made with saut√©ed onions, garlic, broth, and tomatoes. As the soup is boiling drop meatballs made with ground beef or ground turkey (the preference is yours)
    and rice.The meat adds flavory taste to the base. You can add your choice of vegetables to this soup, usually people will add carrots, green beans, and peas.
    This recipe is unique as we add chopped mint into the meatballs. Alternatively, you can add oregano or cilantro but do not do this without trying the mint first. Give it a try!
